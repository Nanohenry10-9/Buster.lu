This app was made for the Game of Code 2018 during the 16 and 17 March.<br><br>Buster.lu is an easy-to-use, website to know the live ETA of Buses. It’s as simple as typing in your bus stop, or selecting your stop with 1 click by using your location… and you’re off on your Bus Traveling needs. It’s made for most of us… the people who know which bus stop and which bus to take but who need to know the real time delays. But it can also be used by tourists by using the map of the bus top placed conveniently below. We made sure that whatever we made, would be beautiful.
Imagine this, you’re enjoying a warm cup of coffee from your favorite Barista. When suddenly you realized you have to go stand for the bus in the cold and rain. ONLY FOR IT TO BE 5 MINUITES LATE!? AND YOU COULD’VE ENJOYED YOUR COFFEE MORE!?
That makes me, as the kids say, Mad AF
Or you’re wondering whether you are going to get your connecting bus in order to be home, so you can play Fortnite with the squad.
Buster.lu… for all the times your lazy ass has to go get a bus.
