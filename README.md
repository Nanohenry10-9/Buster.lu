# Buster.lu

Team CoderDojo's project for the Game of Code hackathon in 2018. Built by @Nanohenry10-9 and
@Leo0a8est with the help of @grischard.

Extract from our pitch at the hackathon:

> Buster.lu is an easy-to-use website to know the live ETA of buses… that everyone can use right
now! It’s as simple as typing in your bus stop's name or using your location, and you’re off on
your traveling needs.

Buster.lu currently uses the [*Arrêts des transports publics / Départs en temps réel* API](http://data.public.lu/en/datasets/arrets-des-transports-publics-departs-en-temps-reel/)
from *Administration des transports publics* in Luxembourg. The API provides a list of all stops as
well as real-time bus, tram, and train departure information for those stops.
